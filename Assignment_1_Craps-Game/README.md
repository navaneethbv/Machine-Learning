1. To execute the Craps game, copy the files C_Game.java and GameofCrap.java onto your workspace.
2. Execute the C_Game.java to observe the output. 
3. The game runs ten simulation of each strategy i.e. Even Wager, Martingale System and Reverse Martingale System.
4. Run the code 5 times to observe the results for 5 rounds.
5. You can also import the war file and run the code (not suggested as few compilers may not support it)
6. I have included the results of each round in the Output folder as well as in the Answer.doc file. 

Reverse Martingale seems to be best strategy as it has yielded the maximum profit over the course of 5 rounds. Martingale seems to be the worst strategy as there have been instances where the user hasnâ€™t been able to complete his quota of 10 games.
Note: The strategies Even Wager and Reverse Martingale ensures that the user gets to play his quota of 10 games per round.
