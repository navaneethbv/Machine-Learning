1. To execute this assignment, copy the R files into the R studio package.
2. Use select all and run the code.
3. Observe the output. (Note - The user can instead execute the lines one after the other and observe the graph before pruning, summary of the variables, graph after pruning and the accuracy of the code)
4. The outputs have been shown in a separate output file.

5. Kyphosis -
a) Accuracy obtained for 80% training data and 20% test data is 88.23529
b) Accuracy obtained for 90% training data and 10% test data is 88.88889
